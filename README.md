## Approach

- We had several thoughts as to what we wanted to build. Whether it was a social feed app or a blogging app, we were both set on the idea to have a fully functional CRUD app built with MERN technologies. We liked the idea of Medium.com so we set out to make an app like it with our own twist.

## User Stories

### Main Functionality

- As a user I want to create articles.
- As a user I want to update my articles.
- As a user I want to delete my own articles.
- As a user I want to sign up.
- As a user I want to sign in.

### Stretch Goals

- As a user I want to comment on articles.
- As a user I want to like other articles.
- As a user I want to be able to save my favorite articles.
- As a user I want to browse other peoples articles.
- As a user I want to click on an article and have a modal pop up.

## Technologies Used

- Bcrypt
- Mongoose
- MongoDB
- Express
- React
- Node.js
- GitHub
- Trello
- Heroku

## Problems

- Implementing the like button and comments feature was a bit more difficult than we had anticipated. The main issue we ran into when trying to add these functionalities was that we have our React app set up differently from how the guides we were trying to follow have them set up. We were too far along into the project to stop and create a new React app.
